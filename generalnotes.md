### Short Bio
I am from Groton, MA and I am a rising senior at Cornell University. I am a double major with CS and Linguistics and hopefully minoring in music. I love to sing and am involved in a choir as well as an a cappella group at Cornell. I work as a barista during the year, which has helped fuel my caffeine dependency, but I also like doing yoga to relax. Ask me about my two kitty cats and I will show you more pictures than is probably socially acceptable.
